# Who is Steve Dondley?
I am the owner and founder of [Prometheus Labor
Communications](http://prometheuslabor.com), a US Navy submarine veteran
and former labor organizer for UFCW Local 1459 in Springfield, MA. I've had an early
[interest in computers](https://steve.dondley.com/Tech-stuff/#computer-hardware) and programming since childhood and a fascination with
mass communication which I developed during my post secondary education at
Grossmont Community College in San Diego and UMass. I combined these passions and
began developing websites for labor unions in in the late 90s. I launched my
company, Prometheus, in 2005.

I served a two-year term as a city councilor in the city of Westfield, MA from
2016 to 2018. I am currently focused on the development of the [UnionConnect
mobile app platform](https://unionconnect.com) my company developed for labor
unions among many other projects.
