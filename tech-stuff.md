# Tech Stuff

Here you'll find a loosely organized compendium of tech tutorials, notes and code snippets. It's probably of little interest unless you dig computers and inhabit my problem space.

This page represents my futile attempt at returning the favor to all of those who have shared their knowledge with me over the web.

## Toots

Tutorials I've written. 

### tmux
* [Super Guide to 'split-window' tmux subcommand (and beyond)](Super-Guide-to-'split-window'-tmux-subcommand-(and-beyond)) 

### neovim/vim

#### Language servers
* [Setting up neovim with a Perl language server](setting_up_lsp_nvim-lspconfig_and_perl_in_neovim.md)
* [Perl Language Servers Part Deux: Fast as FUCK completion with the **NEW** Perl Navigator Language Server](fast_as_fuck_perl_language_server_and_completion.md)
 
# Tech Snips
Useful snippets of code for little jobs.
