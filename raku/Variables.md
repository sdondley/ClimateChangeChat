# Variables

* Any variable can be bound to an object
* sigiled variables can also be assigned to a container

## Sigiless vs. Sigiled variables
* Usually variables with sigils are most useful
* What's a sigil?
    * it's a variable with a funny symbol in front of it
    * Don't worry about the the details right now.
* Sigiled variables automatically have a container associated with them.
    * What's a container?
        * soon, grasshopper
* sigiless variables do not have a container associated with them.
