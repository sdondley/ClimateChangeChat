# What is Raku?
* Fork/rewrite of the Perl programming language
* Ambitious project launched in early 2000s
    * Goal is to be the programming language for the next 100 years 
* First release in 2015
* Originally intended to be called Perl6
    * renamed in 2019 

# Why Raku?
* Easy to learn and start using right away
    * The powerful tools in the language are kept hidden until you need them 
* Very powerful, flexible language
* Very easy to create and distribute new modules
    * [App::Mi6 ](https://raku.land/cpan:SKAJI/App::Mi6)
        * Highly recommended for creating modules 
* Flexible
    * Can write in any common paradigm 
        * procedural
        * object-oriented
        * functional
* Has powerful, new features
    * Grammars 
* It's just fun to play around with and see what I can do with it

# My Adventures with Raku To Date
* Began learning the language in late Dec. 2021
* Good, helpful community
    * IRC
    * On reddit
    * StackOverflow
        * my questions there get upvoted a lot 
* Community is working to get Raku off the ground
    * Thanks to everyone who has helped me and made me feel welcome
* Going to begin writing some code for helping me manage my vimwiki
* Still have much to learn 
    * Learning functional programming style after years of using perl is bit of a mind-bender
