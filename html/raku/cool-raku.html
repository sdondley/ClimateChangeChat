How about the 500th? 50,000th?! Easy (and super fast):</p><pre><code>my $x = ^Inf;
sub get-prime(Int:D $nth) {
    say ($x.grep: *.is-prime)[$nth];
}
for (5, 50, 500, 5000, 50000) { get-prime $_ };
</code></pre><p>When we run this, we get the following output after just a second or two:</p><pre><code>13     # 5th prime
233    # 50th prime
3581   # 500th prime
48619  # 5000th prime
61195  # 50000th prime
</code></pre><p>Can you match this speed and conciseness of this simple bit of code in your
favorite language? I&#39;ll bet you have a hard time writing and executing this
line of code in a reasonable amount of time. But in Raku it&#39;s a snap.</p><p>Let&#39;s walk through this code and see in detail.</p></div>






<div><h2>
<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" id="how-it-works"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h2><p>First we assign variable <code>$x</code> to <code>^Inf</code> to generate a Range of numbers from 0
to infinity. The Range is &quot;lazy,&quot; which means that none of the numbers are
actually generated until we need them. This is unlike an Array where each
element gets calculated ahead of time by the compiler and inserted into the
array and eats up memory. This laziness makes your program much more
efficient. You certainly don&#39;t want to wait around for your computer to count
to infinity but you&#39;d probably run out of memory before then anyway!</p><p>Next we create a simple subroutine called <code>get-prime</code> that accepts a single
argument called <code>$nth</code>. We ensure that <code>$nth</code> is a defined integer object by
slapping <code>Int:D</code> in front of it. The <code>Int</code> means that we must pass an Integer
object and the <code>:D</code> bit ensure that it&#39;s a &quot;definite&quot; object, meaning that it
actually has a value. But thanks to Raku&#39;s flexibility, we could choose to not
<code>Int:D</code> type check our arguments at all. So if need to dash out a simple script
without a lot of hassle and headache trying to keep the compiler happy, Raku
can accomodate your desires, not its own.</p><p>Inside the subroutine is just one line of code consisting of a <code>say</code> routine
that prints out the result of the expression to the right of it to standard
output, followed  by a newline character. Every time <code>get-prime</code> is called, a
new number, the prime number calculated, will be printed out on a separate
line. Here it is:</p><p><code>say ($x.grep: *.is-prime)[$nth];</code></p><p>So how do this calculate which number to print? Well, the first thing you have
to understand is that the code generated inside parentheses results in a data
strcuture called a Sequence, which is basically a list of data in a specific
order. This means Sequences are a type of Positional data structure. For our
purposes of this discussion, that means we can find a specific value in the
Sequence using the square bracket notation, the <code>[$nth]</code> bit you see there on
the end. This is the same number we passed into the subroutines. So this is how
we tell the code in the parentheses which prime number to pull out.</p><p>You can imagine that in between the parentheses is every prime number that can
exist from 0 to infinity (but that hasn&#39;t actually been calculated and so uses
no memory). The number in the brackets chooses which number in that list to
select, whether it be the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 10th, or 10,232nd.</p><p>Now let&#39;s look at what&#39;s inside the parentheses in our line of code in the
subroutine, the code that generates the Sequence. We can see our value <code>$x</code> in
there representing every number possible, both primary and non-primary numbers.
But, we don&#39;t want all numbers, we only want a list of all the primary numbers.
So what we do is run the <code>grep</code> method on our infinite list of numbers by
placing a <code>.</code> after <code>$x</code> and then <code>grep</code>. <code>grep</code> is named after
the command <code>grep</code> which has been found on computers since the 70s to find text
inside of lots of computer files on your hard disk. It&#39;s best to think of
<code>grep</code> as a filter that keeps the stuff we want and removes the stuff we don&#39;t
want from a list of things. And it is the <code>grep</code> method that generates our
Sequence of prime numbers.</p><p>Now all that&#39;s left to do is tell grep what numbers we are interested in. We do
that by passing an argument to <code>grep</code> called <code>*.is-prime</code>. Notice the colon
immediately after <code>grep</code>. That indicates that that what follows is the argument
we will be passing to the <code>grep</code> method.</p><p>So what exactly is the <code>*.is-prime</code> doing? You can think of it as a test that
can be run on every number in the range. First we look at the first number 0 in
the range and determine if it&#39;s prime with the <code>is-prime</code> method, which returns
<code>True</code> if the number is prime and <code>False</code> if it isn&#39;t. If it&#39;s prime, grep puts
it on our list of prime numbers. If it isn&#39;t prime, grep will filter it out and
it won&#39;t go into the Sequence. Then we go to the next number to determine if
it&#39;s prime and so on until we reach infinity.</p><p>But again we have to stress, and what makes this code so fast, is that we only
do these calculations for the prime numbers we are interested in. It would be
very wasteful to calculate the 1,000th prime number when we are only interested
in the 5th.</p><p>You can you think of the <code>*</code> symbol, what Raku calls the &quot;Whatever&quot; object, as
a placeholder for each number in our infinite list (kind of like how the &quot;glob&quot;
character does in popular shell scripts). The <code>.is-prime</code> method which is run
on the &quot;Whatever&quot; object runs a test on each number that will return <code>True</code> if
the number is prime or <code>False</code> if it isn&#39;t. If <code>True</code>, grep puts the tested
number into the Sequence, the list of all the prime numbers, which again, isn&#39;t
actaullly calculated (an impossible task). It just does the minimum work
necessary to determine the specific prime number we are looking for out of the
theoretical series of all prime numbers that exist.</p><p>After the <code>get-prime</code> subroutine, we call it five different times, using a list of
5 numbers using a <code>for loop</code>:</p><p><code>for 5, 50, 500, 5000, 50000 { get-prime $_ };</code></p><p>For each number in the list of numbers we supply, we run the code in the curly
braces which, in turn, calls the <code>get-prime</code> subroutine for us. The technical
term for this kind of looping process is called &quot;iteration&quot;.</p><p>Note the <code>$_</code> variable in the curly braces. It has a special meaning in Raku.
It is called the &quot;topic variable.&quot; It&#39;s helpful to think of it to mean the
&quot;topic&quot; of discussion. Each time we iterate over the list of our numbers, the
topic variable gets assigned to the next number in the list and this becomes
the value the <code>get-prime</code> receives for its <code>$nth</code> argument.</p><p>Wow, so that&#39;s a lot words to explain just a little bit of code. It
demonstrates the power of Raku and how how efficient it can be. Amazingly, we
can make this bit of code even more concise:</p><p><code>(for 5, 50, 500, 5000, 50000 { (^Inf :grep *.is-prime)[$_] }).say</code></p><p>And don&#39;t worry if this seems a little overwhelming. Most of Raku is much more
straightforward than this example so don&#39;t let yourself get scared off. But as
you can begin to see, Raku excels at taking hard problems and making them a
whole lot easier, even problems that are nearly impossible or impractical in
many other programming languages.</p><p>The brevity of Raku&#39;s code also makes it much easier to understand what a large
code base is doing because the code won&#39;t be cluttered with dozens of lines of
code. And, of course, fewer lines of code means fewer bugs. And for the bugs
that do crop up, they&#39;ll be easier for you to isolate and squash.</p></div>
