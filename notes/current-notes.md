    * from 2008
    * seems like a bit of a doom an gloomer
        * but still named "joy" 
    * we are in asymmetric warfare against individual bad actors with extraorindary amounts of power as a result of new tech
    * venture capitalist now
    * founded Sun microsystems
    * wrote vi text editor in 1976
    * concerned about future
        * climate change
* What is Bill Joy up to now?
    * seems to have dropped off the map 
    * looks like he's retired from venture capitalism
    * good chance he's disillusioned 
        * seems to have gone silent on things 
        * or could just be trying to enjoy the rest of his life
    * more recent video about crispr genetic tech
