    * Name:
        * Climate Change Chat for Realists
            * This is the same name as a livestream project I do 
                * Why? 
                    * Because I want to call attention to my project
    * Goals:
        * make it exceptionally update and maintain
            * will be less likely to abandon a project that is less of a paint to update 
        * share ideas and notes with other easily and quickly
        * keep track of shit
    * Under the hood tech:
        * all content is published to github to private repo
            * all new content is publshed with vim map:
                * <leader>www 
                    * saves the file 
                    * commits changes to repo
                    * pushes changes out
        * content is pulled in every minute to web server running a cron
        * vim text editor
            * all pages are created and edited with it
            * about
                * used heavily by open source coders 
            * benefits 
                * absolutely the fastest way to input and maniupalate text 
            * plugins used
                * vimwiki
                    * easily creates outline and links
                    * allows pages written in markdown format
                    * converts pages to html using a ruby gem
                        * vimwiki 
                    * also uses some special sauce code that I wrote
                * taskwiki
                    * a bridge between taskwarrior task software and vimwiki 
                    * allows vimwiki to be the interface for managing tasks
    * Why is it written mostly in outline form:
        * It's much faster to write this way
        * Ideas can be conveyed very succinctly
