# Climate Change

# Why I'm Into Climate Change
* Easy, this is the most important issue facing all people and living things on the planet
* Why is climate change so important?
    * Climate change has the potential to cause vase ecological damage, humand suffering, and social/economic upheaval 

# What I'm Trying to Do
* I obviously can't tackle the issue myself so I do what I can
* Scientists and communication specialists tell us the best way for ordinary people to help address climate change is to talk about it
    * This is why I started my "Climage Change Chat for Realists" project

## Climate Change Chat for Realists
* What is it?
    * Curently, it's a livestream 
        * Twitch
        * YouTube
        * Looking into doing Facebook in the future
    * I do live interviews with people
        * Who do you interview? 
            * Anyone doing anything interesting about climate change 
* Status or project
    * On brief hiatus while I tend to other things 
        * Hope to be back by mid-Feb 2022
