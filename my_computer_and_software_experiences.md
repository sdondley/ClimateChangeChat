# My Computer Hardware and Software Experiences

## Free Software (Open Source)
I'm a huge fan of the Free Software Movement, though I don't always live up to
its highest ideals. For better or worse, I'm a pragmatist when it comes to
choosing software to use. But I'm a huge believer in sharing my own work and
enjoy it immensely.

### My computer hardware history

#### Early years
Since I was a young boy, I've always been fascinated by all things digital. The
first bit of technology to transfix me was owned by my cousin's husband,
Jimmy Wagner. It was a watch and instead of hands it had glowing LED numbers. It
was probably 1975 and I was 5 years old. If the watch wasn't the [Pulsar
P3](https://20centurywatches.com/pulsar-p3/), it was something very close to
it.

I begged my parents and relatives for a digital watch as a present but, of
course, they weren't about to spend a couple hundred bucks on a watch for a
little kid (I did get a cool Snoopy analog watch, though). I don't think it was
until 1979 that I finally got a digital watch. Although it had a liquid crystal
display rather than an LED face and had an ugly, goofy, stiff brown plastic
wristband that was supposed to look like alligator skin, it was good enough for
me.

Here's a rough timeline of some of the other hardware I've owned as well as
other experiences that inspired my or left some kind of permanent mark on my wetware.

* 1977?
    * [Little Professor - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Professor)
        * It had the magical, glowing red numbers, just like the digital watch
* Christmas 1977 (or could have been '78)
    * First video game console: [Coleco Telstar Arcade - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleco_Telstar_Arcade)
* 1980 or '81
    * My first use of a computer attached to a network
        * Armory Street School, 5th or 6th grade
        * It was some kind of horizonal teletype machine with a keyboad connected
                computer in downtown Springfield
            * was very excited to play with it occassionally
            * it could play simple games such as madlibs, tic-tac-toe, etc.
* Early 80s
    * Various hand-held games
        * [Coleco Head to Head Football](https://www.handheldmuseum.com/Coleco/H2HFootball.htm)

        * It was purchased by my brother, 10 years older than me, while he was in
            college
            * I'm not sure if he ever intended to use it for himself but he never did
                so it essentially became mine.
            * It sits in my basement to this day
                * Worked as of about 2015 when I last tried it out
                * one of the disks or memory unit was a little flaky, though
                    * somehow managed to work around the issue
        * Learned Apple Basic with it using the book that came with it
        * Used it for gaming, as well
            * Had all the Zork games
        * Wrote a database program to obsessively store all the videos I saw on MTV.

                up the stairs after every video
        * Conceived a graphical software maze game in 3-D.
            * Never finished it (and barely started it) but I'm sure it would have

            hours on it seeing what it could do compared to my Apple IIe
    * My brother-in-law worked in the software industry and had some kind of

#### The Apple FanBoi Years
I've kind of lost track of all the Apple products I've purchased over the past
12 years. Here they are to the best of my recollection. I've easily spent
roughly $30K on them which is probably a bit obsessive, I'll admit. We've all
got our vices. Still cheaper than buying a new car every few years.
