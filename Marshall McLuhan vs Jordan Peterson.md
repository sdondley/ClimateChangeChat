# A Tale of Two Gurus

Not so long ago, a middle-aged professor, born in Alberta, working in relative
obscurity at the University of Toronto, unexpectedly transformed himself into a
media sensation. His books started selling millions with two of them
simultaneously occupying spots on bestseller lists. He became the subject of
countless articles and a frequent guest of prominent media personalities trying
to wrap their heads around what, exactly, this modern-day prophet from academia
could tell us about a world that seemed as if it might soon unravel. Could this
erudite man's theories and insights have ideas for keeping destructive
societal forces at bay? Could he help us make sense of the chaos enveloping
modern life? What if he's right about what the modern information age is doing
to our brains?

I'm not talking about Jordan Peterson. I'm talking about Marshall McLuhan, an
English professor who became the secular guru of his time, the late 1960s.

What qualities made McLuhan and his ideas such an intense subject of endless
speculation and fascination? How do these qualities differ from the qualites
that have done the same for Peterson? And What do these comparisons tell us
about state of the world today? Well, let's take a look, shall we?
